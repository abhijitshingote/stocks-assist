I have found it hard to review all the strong stocks on a daily basis. So, while that is important and needed to get context of the market - we need a AI summary of that.

This is meant to provide actionable signals with a STOP!
1. Swing Reversals - Lower lows or higher highs broken - cool stop. Identifying these can be challenging. Dont strive for perfection
2. Emergence - This should be relative strength based but the idea is to spot this early. RS has been hard to use due to being very volatile need a rethink. If too much smoothing, you are late. If too sensitive, too volatile
3. Strong stocks flags
4. Strong stocks previous high support
5. Strong stocks MA support
6. Longer Slower Moving average like 50 & 200. Wait for breach on a long term period , retest and either buy at retest and add on confirmation - stop baked in!

For the above , each category needs to be targeted against a market cap bucket. For example anything below 1B doesnt apply for longer slower MA breach. Similarly, Aggression around flags or MA support should be higher for smaller cap vs larger
