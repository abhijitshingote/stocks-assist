1. Identify all stocks that have moved atleast 3.5x(maybe adjustable) in a period of 6-8 months
2. What kind of action preceded the big move, Time frame to consider is 
    a. before the big move? for example is there a big vol candle
    b. and then when the stock lets say doubles, during that period where it doubles are there multiple significantly higher volume candles that supplement the double. Are there lower moves with high volume candles. High volume criteria is before the move began, calculate average volume. and then how many 2.5x+ average volume candels during the first double
3. Once we quantify the above, in true statiscal framework, how many stocks failed from the double to eventually move 3.5 x higher despite the same many high volume candles accompanying the first double
