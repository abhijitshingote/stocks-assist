# Environment Assumptions
- I am using WSL2 on Windows.
- All commands should be written assuming a Linux environment.
- Use Docker and docker-compose and most scripts should be run inside the backend container.
- Do not generate Windows PowerShell or CMD commands unless explicitly asked.
- Assume code will run inside WSL using Ubuntu.

When I type TEST123, always respond with OK.
