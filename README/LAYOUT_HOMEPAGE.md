HomePage
Zone - Green , Red , Orange - Need to define business logic TBD

Should have main indices section that is a 2 row section shows SPY, QQQ, IWM, VIX on first row
and second row gold, silver, oil, 10Y yield
and their 1D, 5D, 20D, 60D performance
and how much above or below the 50DMA and 200DMA. color the in green or red background to call attention on above or below 50DMA and 200DMA.
I should be able to quickly view charts for any of them so they expand inline as needed.

Below that section
Sector ETFs
Display performance for the following slices 1D, 5D, 20D, 60D
Seperate section for risk on 
XLB, XLC, XLY, XLE, XLF, XLV, XLI, XLK
and then for risk off
XLP, XLRE, XLU


Then we need a section for breadth
No. of Stocks above/below 50DMA and 200DMA
No. of stocks taht moved 4% higher, 4% lower
And we want to visualize this on a 1 year chart
