We like it . nice hedge to AI\nHere\u2019s a straight, fact-based summary of why nLIGHT (NASDAQ: LASR) has surged ~600% since April 2025 \u2014 focusing on material, market-moving events and not jokes or speculation.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 \nCore Drivers of the Stock Rally\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategic Pivot Into Aerospace & Defense \u2014 Becoming a Growth Story\nnLIGHT has transformed from an industrial/commercial laser company into a defense-focused high-growth business, with aerospace & defense now contributing ~65\u201368% of total revenue and growing rapidly. This pivot has fundamentally reshaped investor expectations about future growth and margins.  \nA&D revenue grew sharply in both Q2 and Q3 2025 \u2014 up ~50% YoY in Q3 \u2014 and during Q2 it comprised roughly two-thirds of total sales.  \nCompany raised its A&D growth outlook to at least ~40% YoY for full-year 2025, significantly above prior guidance.  \nInvestors love structural growth narratives \u2014 especially one tied to defense budgets and long-term national security programs.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Consistent Beat on Revenue, Margins, and Profitability Metrics\nnLIGHT hasn\u2019t just grown revenue \u2014 it\u2019s also improving profitability and financial execution:\nRecord product gross margins (~41%) on defense shipments, up significantly versus prior year.  \nAdjusted EBITDA turned positive after years of losses as the business scales.  \nEPS beats and stronger profitability signals: Q3 2025 EPS came in much better than expected (e.g., ~$0.08 vs. consensus of ~$0.01), highlighting improved financials.  \nThis combination of growth + margin expansion + improving profitability tends to drive re-ratings in small/medium cap stocks.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Major Defense Program Wins and Backlog\nWhile many investors originally paid attention to growth metrics, specific defense programs provide long-term revenue visibility:\nHigh-Energy Defense Programs\nHELSI-2 (High Energy Laser Scaling Initiative): A technically advanced, multi-year U.S. Department of Defense contract with substantial revenue projected over future years (hundreds of millions). nLIGHT has begun shipping components and expects accelerated deliveries through 2025.  \nArmy Directed Energy Programs\nShort-Range Air Defense (SHORAD) / Army high-energy laser projects \u2014 these are seen as practical near-term revenue sources and part of broader U.S. defense modernization priorities.  \nInvestors often de-risk the stock when they see contracts convert into repeatable revenue, and that is part of nLIGHT\u2019s current narrative.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Perception Shift (Market Narrative)\nWhat the market is now pricing in:\nnLIGHT as a pure-play defense tech growth stock rather than an industrial commodity laser player.\nContinued margin expansion from higher-value defense products.\nStronger cash generation and reduced net losses, meaning capital risk feels lower.\nAnalyst attention and upgraded price targets have accompanied this narrative shift, further reinforcing the stock\u2019s upward momentum.  \n\n\ud83d\udcca \nSo What Changed Starting in April 2025?\nWhile April is somewhat arbitrary, the rally roughly aligns with:\n\u2714 Consistent quarterly performance beats (Q1 \u2192 Q2 \u2192 Q3 2025) showing sustained execution\n\u2714 A&D revenue growth significantly accelerating and becoming the core business\n\u2714 Visible defense program backlogs and raised outlooks\n\u2714 Margins and adjusted EBITDA materially improving\nAll of these shift nLIGHT\u2019s valuation framework from cyclical industrial tech to strategic defense growth with structural sales lifts, which tends to drive multiples higher in the market.\n\n\ud83d\udd11 \nQuick Summary of Material, Game-Changing Events\nTransformation into a defense-dominated revenue profile, with A&D now ~65\u201368% of sales and growing rapidly.  \nRecord gross margins (~41%) and profitability signals (positive adjusted EBITDA), lifting valuation.  \nEarnings / guidance beats showing execution beyond expectations.  \nLarge defense programs under way (HELSI-2, SHORAD/Army directed energy) providing backlog and visibility.  \nUpgraded growth outlooks and analyst interest as narrative moves from cyclicality toward secular defense demand.  \n\n\ud83d\udcc9 \nRisks Investors Still Watch\nDefense programs have technical execution risk and timing risk \u2014 missing milestones could hurt sentiment.  \nCommercial markets (industrial / microfabrication) remain weak or declining.  \n\nIf you want, I can provide a timeline of key contract awards and earnings dates correlated to major share price moves \u2014 that\u2019s useful to see exactly what news moved the stock.\n",
